A repo to keep my programs created from r/DailyProgrammer, CoderByte, etc

programs will require [FunctionTest](https://gitlab.com/gregmcintyre/FunctionTest) to run or just comment out test() code, and run with print() lined

If/when I return to these it will be at https://gitlab.com/gregmcintyre/r-dailyprogrammer I may push to here occcasionally.
